---
We hope to provide a fair platform for dissenting voices at here at [rejectbbi.org](https://rejectbbi.org). However, we also strive to be a reputable source of high quality information to our readers. Before submitting an article for publishing please review the following guidelines to increase the chances of your post being approved.


## Authorship guidelines
### Respectfulness
Respect the opinions of other think tanks. Do not attack the character or other attributes of a person making an argument, but rather attack the individual ([Ad hominem attacks](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Ad-Hominem.html)). 

### Thoroughness
Ensure due research is made about the subject matter. Consult alternative authorities, with respect to the guidelines on "permissions." Avoid click-baity articles, baseless claims, or otherwise filler text that does not move the discussion forward.

### Legal 
All content should abide by the laws of the land. Avoid inciteful narratives, or baseless accusatory claims. Refrain from calling out individuals unless it is relevant to the argument. 

### Clarity
Use language that is simple to understand in order to communicate ideas effectively. Avoid jargon and/or other esoteric lingo. Whenever it is absolutely necessary, explain the meaning of terms used and provide context for the reader. 

### Permissions
Authors should cite information sourced from others. This includes attribution for media, and references to journals, texts, and books. Cross-publishing is permitted, but only if explicitly stated as such within the post. 

## Project scope
In order to have the most impact to our readership, we have considered a number of topics that weave in to form a clear narrative. It is recommended that articles touch on these issues, but these are not hard and fast rules.

### Rundown of the BBI
The Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020, also commonly referred to as BBI (Bulding Bridges Initiative) is a raft of consitutional changes set to be put to the poll in a national referendum. We seek to enlighten our readership on the *actual* content of the bill, by publishing a rundown of the bill in verbatim or with minimal paraphrasing. 

Additionally, we shall embrace the history and origin of the bill.

### Motives behind the bill
What are the motives addressed in the bill? What challenges are being addressed? 

This theme will analyze the stengths of the bill, in an objective manner.

### Implications of the bill
The changes proposed by the BBI might have a huge impact on the progress of the nation. The proposals will affect not just arms of the government but possibly other sectors. It is important to note, that the changes go beyond what is stated in the bill and might be eventualities of the system.

### Alternative approaches
It is essential to study alterntive solutions to the challenges addressed by the bill, and possibly ways to generally solve other perennial challenges in the country.

### Wanjiku's story
How does the "common mwananchi" interact with the bill. How will their lives be affected the bill? This might be the most important theme in the blog as in surpasses intellectual discourse for many people.

### Call to Action
Engaging in activites to understand the bill, such as reading or contributing to projects such as this is important. However, there are other civil procedures to make your voices be heard.
