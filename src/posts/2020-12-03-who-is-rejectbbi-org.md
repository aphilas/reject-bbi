RejectBBI.org is a team that is setting up a platform to counter the pro-BBI movement. We aim to educate on what the BBI is, and objectively critique it.

In the coming days we will keep this site updated and available for you.

Be on the lookout for more from the team. We are still open to new ideas on how best to reach the people. Please reach out to us on [info@rejectbbi.org](mailto:info@rejectbbi.org).
